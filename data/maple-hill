This home was picked up and moved in early 2013, to a spot some six miles away from its original location. The man who had purchased the land and house wanted to tear it down and build a new home on the spot, so a preservationist purchased the house alone from him and moved it a few miles down the road. It is alleged to be haunted by residual energy from previous owners, who, later in life committed suicide. Whether the energy stayed in the old spot or moved on with the house is as yet to be determined.
