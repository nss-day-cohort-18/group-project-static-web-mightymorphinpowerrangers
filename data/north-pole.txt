Imagine standing at the top of the Earth, glass of champagne in hand – and everywhere you look is south. That is the essence of the 14-day North Pole: The Ultimate Arctic Adventure aboard 50 Years of Victory, the most powerful nuclear icebreaker in the world. Crush through multiyear ice on the Arctic Ocean, sightsee by helicopter on the lookout for walruses, seals, whales, and polar bears, or take a tethered hot-air balloon ride at 90º N, weather permitting. Possible stops at the island of Franz Josef Land will have you in awe of the flora and fauna as you visit seabird colonies and retrace the footsteps of early explorers.
